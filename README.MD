2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "Pierres-Bakery".
3. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal.
